Hello!
Thank you for using my program.
I have ltalk.py and vk.py for downloaded html pages, to add them in diary. Also, you can use new.py, to add usual text records. Soon there will be version for online downloading and sinc with those services 

If you don't like default avatar, just go in "Diary/.exstras/Media", and change image "ava.jpg" on any other image, but name must still be "ava.jpg"
